The early detection of lung diseases is critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates.
This project explores the development and application of machine learning (ML) models to predict various lung diseases using medical imaging and clinical data. 
By leveraging advanced ML techniques, including deep learning and traditional algorithms, this study aims to create a robust, accurate, and
scale-able predictive system for the early identification of lung pathologies.
The project encompasses several stages, starting with data collection and preprocessing, where diverse datasets comprising chest X-rays, CT scans, and
patient health records are gathered and standardized. Feature extraction techniques are employed to highlight significant patterns and markers indicative of various lung diseases. 
Subsequently, different ML models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained and validated using these features to ascertain their predictive capabilities.
Model performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to ensure reliability and generalizability.
The best-performing models are then fine-tuned and integrated into a user-friendly interface that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed diagnostic decisions.
This project also addresses potential challenges such as data imbalance, overfitting, and interpretability of ML models. Techniques like data augmentation, regularization, and
explainable AI (XAI) are employed to mitigate these issues, enhancing the model's robustness and transparency.
